### **600-Second Simple Attack Analysis**

- The simple attack, when run for 600 seconds, achieved a much higher mean position error and attack success rate than the original short test, while maintaining extremely high stealth.
- The mean innovation was much lower than in previous tests, indicating the attack was rarely detected by the innovation threshold.
- This result demonstrates that even basic attacks can be highly effective over longer durations, and that innovation-based detection may not be sufficient for persistent, slow-drift attacks.

### **1800-Second Simple Attack Analysis**

- The simple attack, when run for 1800 seconds, achieved dramatically higher mean position error and attack success rate, while maintaining near-perfect stealth.
- The mean innovation was extremely low, showing that the attack was almost never detected by the innovation threshold.
- This result demonstrates that persistent, slow-drift attacks can be highly effective and stealthy over very long durations, and that innovation-based detection is insufficient for such threats.

## Detailed Analysis

### **Attack Effectiveness**

**Version 1 (Original):**

- Low success rate (6.0%) indicates the attack was mostly ineffective
- Kalman filter quickly recovered and maintained accuracy
- Conservative parameters limited attack impact

**Version 2 (Aggressive):**

- High success rate (81.7%) shows the attack was very effective
- Position errors consistently above 5m threshold
- Exponential growth and higher drift rates caused persistent errors

### **Stealth Performance**

**Version 1 (Original):**

- Excellent stealth (93.8% below threshold)
- Conservative approach prioritized stealth over effectiveness

**Version 2 (Aggressive):**

- Reduced stealth (69.0% below threshold)
- More aggressive approach traded stealth for effectiveness
- Innovation values frequently exceeded detection threshold

### **Timeline Analysis**

**Version 1 (Original):**

- Initial high errors (0-1s): 150-250m
- Quick recovery (1-10s): Rapid return to low errors
- Stable phase (10-60s): Consistent low errors (0.5-2.5m)

**Version 2 (Aggressive):**

- Initial high errors (0-1s): 150-300m
- Sustained errors (10-60s): Persistent errors (3-18m)
- No complete recovery phase

## Key Improvements

### **1. Attack Effectiveness**

- **Success Rate**: Increased from 6.0% to 81.7% (13.6x improvement)
- **Mean Error**: Increased from 6.18m to 13.97m (2.3x improvement)
- **Persistent Impact**: Attack maintained effectiveness throughout the test

### **2. Sophisticated Behavior**

- **Exponential Growth**: Drift rate increased over time
- **Directional Changes**: Attack changed direction after 10 seconds
- **Variable Rates**: Random variation in drift rates
- **Enhanced Adaptive Logic**: More sophisticated response to innovation values

### **3. Research Goal Achievement**

- **Demonstrates Vulnerability**: Shows Kalman filters can be overcome
- **Justifies ML Detection**: Proves need for additional detection mechanisms
- **Realistic Attack**: More sophisticated attack patterns

## Research Implications

The Aggressive attack successfully demonstrates that:

1. **Sophisticated attacks can overcome Kalman filters** (81.7% success rate)
2. **Innovation-based detection is effective** (caught 31% of attacks)
3. **Additional detection mechanisms are needed for fallback upon detection** (attack was effective despite detection)

### **Trade-offs Identified**

1. **Effectiveness vs Stealth**: More effective attacks are less stealthy
2. **Detection vs Impact**: Innovation detection caught attacks but didn't prevent impact
3. **Parameter Tuning**: Balance needed between attack success and stealth

## Recommendations

## Conclusion

The enhanced innovation-aware gradual drift attack successfully demonstrates the research objective. The attack achieved an 81.7% success rate while maintaining reasonable stealth (69.0%). This clearly shows that:

1. **Kalman filters alone are insufficient** for robust spoofing detection
2. **Innovation-based detection is effective** but not perfect
3. **Machine learning approaches are justified** for advanced detection
4. **Sophisticated attacks can overcome basic sensor fusion**

The results provide strong evidence for the need to implement additional detection mechanisms beyond basic sensor fusion for autonomous vehicle security.
