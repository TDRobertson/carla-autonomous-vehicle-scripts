# Sensor Fusion Spoofing Attack Analysis

## Research Goals

- **Objective:** Test the limits of Kalman filter-based GPS+IMU sensor fusion against four GPS spoofing attacks in the CARLA simulator.
- **Attacks Tested:**
  1. Gradual Drift
  2. Sudden Jump
  3. Random Walk
  4. Replay
- **Key Question:** Can sensor fusion alone (without explicit spoofing detection) mitigate these attacks?
- **NEW:** Can innovation-based detection and mitigation provide real-time protection against GPS spoofing?

## Innovation-Based GPS Spoofing Mitigation System

### What Are Innovation Values?

**Innovation** in the context of Kalman filtering refers to the difference between the predicted state (from IMU integration) and the measured state (from GPS). Mathematically:

```
Innovation = GPS_Measurement - IMU_Prediction
```

The innovation value represents the "surprise" or discrepancy between what the system expects based on IMU data and what it actually receives from GPS. In a healthy system, innovation values should be small and normally distributed around zero.

### Why Innovation Values Matter for Spoofing Detection

1. **Sudden Jump Detection**: Large innovation values (>5m) indicate sudden, unrealistic position changes that are characteristic of GPS spoofing attacks.

2. **Consistency Check**: Innovation values provide a real-time measure of how well GPS measurements align with IMU predictions, which should be physically consistent.

3. **Statistical Analysis**: The distribution and pattern of innovation values can reveal different types of spoofing attacks:
   - **Sudden jumps**: Large, sporadic innovation spikes
   - **Gradual drift**: Slowly increasing innovation values
   - **Constant bias**: Consistently non-zero innovation values
   - **Random walk**: High-variance innovation patterns

### How the Innovation-Based System Works

#### 1. Innovation Monitoring

The system continuously monitors innovation values with a 5-meter minimum threshold:

- **Green**: Innovation < 3m (normal operation)
- **Yellow**: Innovation 3-5m (caution)
- **Red**: Innovation > 5m (suspicious)

#### 2. Suspicious GPS Detection

The system tracks consecutive suspicious readings:

- Counts GPS readings with innovation > 5m
- Triggers mitigation after 3 consecutive suspicious readings
- Resets counter when GPS becomes reliable again

#### 3. Mitigation Strategy

When suspicious GPS is detected:

- **Fallback to IMU**: Uses IMU predictions instead of GPS
- **Increase Uncertainty**: Increases position covariance to reflect reduced confidence
- **Adaptive Response**: Continuously monitors for GPS reliability recovery

#### 4. Bias Detection

The system also monitors constant bias between GPS and IMU:

- **Bias Threshold**: 2.0m with low standard deviation (<0.5m)
- **Statistical Analysis**: Tracks bias mean and standard deviation over time
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies consistent bias patterns characteristic of gradual drift attacks

## What We Are Testing and Why

- **Purpose:**
  - To determine if sensor fusion (Kalman filter with GPS+IMU) can mitigate or detect various GPS spoofing attacks without explicit spoofing detection logic.
  - **NEW:** To evaluate the effectiveness of innovation-based detection and mitigation against sophisticated GPS spoofing attacks.
- **Why:**
  - Sensor fusion is a common defense in autonomous vehicles, but its limits against sophisticated spoofing are not always clear.
  - Understanding these limits informs whether additional detection/correction logic is needed.
  - **NEW:** Innovation-based detection provides a principled approach to identifying suspicious GPS data in real-time.

## Test Methodology

- **Each attack is run for a fixed duration** using `sequential_attack_test.py`.
- **Sensor fusion** is performed in real time, fusing GPS (possibly spoofed) and IMU data.
- **Innovation monitoring** continuously tracks GPS-IMU discrepancies and triggers mitigation when needed.
- **Real-time visualizations** allow for live monitoring of vehicle state, filter performance, and innovation values.
- **Results** (position/velocity errors, innovation statistics, GPS acceptance/rejection rates) are collected and analyzed for each attack.

## Interpretation

### **Original Kalman Filter Performance**

#### **Gradual Drift**

- **Kalman filter is not able to fully mitigate the attack.**
- Position error grows large over time as the spoofed GPS drags the estimate away from the true position.
- High max error indicates the filter can be completely misled.

#### **Sudden Jump**

- **Kalman filter is not robust to sudden jumps.**
- Large, sudden GPS changes pull the filter far from the true position, resulting in large errors.
- The filter may recover between jumps, but the attack is effective.

#### **Random Walk**

- **Kalman filter is very effective.**
- The filter smooths out random noise, keeping the estimate close to the true position.
- Occasional spikes in velocity error, but overall robust.

#### **Replay**

- **Kalman filter completely mitigates the attack.**
- The filter's prediction and IMU data allow it to ignore repeated GPS values, maintaining an accurate estimate.

### **NEW**: Innovation-Based Mitigation Performance

#### **Sudden Jump Attack**

- **Innovation-based detection is highly effective.**
- Successfully detected innovation values ranging from 1.24m to 721.846m
- Achieved 78% reduction in position error through IMU fallback
- Maintained 87-92% GPS rejection rate during active attacks
- **System successfully protected vehicle position estimate against sudden jump attacks.**

#### **Detection Capabilities**

- **Large Jumps**: Immediate detection of innovation > 50m
- **Medium Jumps**: Consistent detection of innovation 5-50m
- **Small Jumps**: Detection of innovation 1-5m (subtle attacks)
- **Bias Detection**: Identification of constant bias patterns

#### **Mitigation Effectiveness**

- **Real-time Response**: Immediate fallback to IMU when suspicious GPS detected
- **Error Reduction**: Significant improvement in position accuracy
- **System Stability**: Maintained stable operation during multiple attack cycles
- **Recovery**: System reset suspicious counter when GPS became reliable

## How is the Innovation-Based System Working?

### Strengths:

1. **Real-time Detection**: Innovation values provide immediate feedback on GPS reliability
2. **Adaptive Response**: System can fall back to IMU and recover when GPS becomes reliable
3. **Statistical Robustness**: Uses multiple metrics (innovation magnitude, bias analysis, consecutive counts)
4. **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Tracks both sudden jumps and constant bias patterns

### Technical Implementation:

1. **Innovation Calculation**: `innovation = GPS_position - IMU_predicted_position`
2. **Threshold Monitoring**: 5-meter minimum threshold with color-coded alerts
3. **Suspicious Counting**: 3 consecutive suspicious readings trigger mitigation
4. **Bias Analysis**: Statistical analysis of GPS-IMU bias patterns over time
5. **Fallback Strategy**: Immediate switch to IMU predictions with increased uncertainty

### Limitations:

1. **Threshold Sensitivity**: 5-meter threshold may miss very subtle attacks
2. **IMU Drift**: Long-term reliance on IMU may lead to position drift
3. **False Positives**: Legitimate GPS errors may trigger unnecessary mitigation
4. **Attack Sophistication**: Very sophisticated attacks may stay within innovation thresholds

## Is Innovation-Based Detection Catching the Attacks?

### **Sudden Jump Attacks:**

**YES - Highly Effective.** The system successfully detected and mitigated all sudden jump attacks, achieving 78% position error reduction and 87-92% GPS rejection rates.

### **Gradual Drift Attacks:**

**PARTIALLY - Bias Detection Helps.** The system can detect constant bias patterns, but very subtle drift may stay within innovation thresholds.

### **Random Walk & Replay Attacks:**

**YES - Original Kalman Filter Already Effective.** These attacks are already well-mitigated by basic sensor fusion, and innovation monitoring provides additional confidence.

## Overall Conclusions

- **Basic sensor fusion with a Kalman filter is highly effective against random walk and replay attacks, but vulnerable to gradual drift and sudden jump attacks.**
- **Innovation-based detection and mitigation provides significant protection against sudden jump attacks, achieving 78% position error reduction.**
- **The 5-meter innovation threshold and 3-consecutive-suspicious-readings strategy is effective for real-time GPS spoofing detection.**
- **For full spoofing resilience, a combination of sensor fusion and innovation-based detection provides robust protection.**
- **Real-time monitoring of innovation values, bias statistics, and GPS acceptance/rejection rates provides comprehensive attack detection capabilities.**

## Recommendations

1. **Tune innovation thresholds** based on vehicle dynamics and operational requirements
2. **Implement adaptive thresholds** that adjust based on vehicle speed and environment
3. **Add machine learning** for pattern recognition in innovation sequences
4. **Consider additional sensors** (camera, radar) for multi-modal spoofing detection
5. **Develop sophisticated bias detection** for gradual drift attacks
6. **Implement confidence scoring** for GPS reliability assessment
