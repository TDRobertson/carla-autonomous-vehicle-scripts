# Innovation-Based GPS Spoofing Mitigation System

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of an innovation-based GPS spoofing mitigation system that uses Kalman filter innovation values to detect and mitigate various types of GPS spoofing attacks.

## Key Features

### 1. Innovation-Based Detection

- **Innovation Threshold**: 5.0 meters (minimum)
- **Detection Method**: Monitors the difference between GPS measurements and IMU-predicted positions
- **Suspicious Count Threshold**: 3 consecutive suspicious readings trigger mitigation

### 2. Mitigation Strategy

- **Fallback to IMU**: When GPS is consistently suspicious, the system falls back to IMU predictions
- **Covariance Increase**: Increases position uncertainty when falling back to IMU
- **Adaptive Response**: Resets suspicious counter when GPS data becomes reliable again

### 3. Bias Detection

- **Constant Bias Detection**: Identifies consistent bias between GPS and IMU readings
- **Bias Threshold**: 2.0 meters with low standard deviation (< 0.5m)
- **Statistical Analysis**: Tracks bias mean and standard deviation over time

## Implementation Details

### Enhanced Kalman Filter (`advanced_kalman_filter.py`)

#### New Features:

- **Innovation Tracking**: Maintains history of innovation magnitudes
- **Suspicious GPS Detection**: Counts consecutive suspicious readings
- **Bias Analysis**: Tracks GPS-IMU bias patterns
- **Mitigation Logic**: Implements fallback to IMU when needed

#### Key Methods:

```python
def update_with_gps(self, gps_pos, imu_predicted_pos=None):
    # Returns True if GPS accepted, False if rejected

def _check_suspicious_gps(self, innovation_magnitude, gps_pos, imu_predicted_pos):
    # Checks for sudden jumps and constant bias

def get_innovation_stats(self):
    # Returns innovation statistics for monitoring

def get_bias_stats(self):
    # Returns bias statistics for monitoring
```

### Enhanced GPS Spoofer (`gps_spoofer.py`)

#### Improved Attack Strategies:

1. **Gradual Drift** (`_gradual_drift_improved`):

   - Reduced drift rate: 0.05 m/s (from 0.1 m/s)
   - Added random fluctuations: Â±0.02m
   - Innovation-aware: Stays within 4.5m threshold
   - More subtle and harder to detect

2. **Sudden Jump** (`_sudden_jump_improved`):

   - Innovation-aware jumping: Adapts jump size based on current innovation
   - Reduced probability: 0.5% (from 1%)
   - Cooldown period: 10 seconds between jumps
   - Adaptive magnitude: 3.0m, 2.1m, or 1.2m based on innovation level

3. **Random Walk** (`_random_walk_improved`):

   - Directional persistence: 70% chance to continue in similar direction
   - Reduced step size: 0.2m (from 0.5m)
   - More realistic movement patterns

4. **Replay Attack** (`_replay_attack_improved`):
   - Added noise to replayed positions
   - More sophisticated replay mechanism
   - Harder to detect than simple replay

#### Innovation Awareness:

```python
def update_innovation(self, innovation_magnitude):
    # Updates spoofer with current innovation for adaptive attacks
```

### Enhanced Sensor Fusion (`sensor_fusion.py`)

#### New Monitoring Capabilities:

- **GPS Acceptance/Rejection Tracking**: Counts accepted vs rejected GPS readings
- **Innovation Statistics**: Real-time innovation monitoring
- **Bias Statistics**: GPS-IMU bias analysis
- **Mitigation Status**: Tracks when mitigation is active

#### Key Methods:

```python
def get_innovation_stats(self):
    # Returns innovation statistics

def get_bias_stats(self):
    # Returns bias statistics

def get_gps_stats(self):
    # Returns GPS acceptance/rejection statistics
```

## Testing and Validation

### Test Script (`test_innovation_mitigation.py`)

A comprehensive test script that:

- Tests all four attack types
- Monitors innovation values in real-time
- Tracks GPS acceptance/rejection rates
- Provides effectiveness assessment
- Shows mitigation status

#### Usage:

```bash
python test_innovation_mitigation.py [attack_type]
```

Available attack types:

- `gradual_drift`: Subtle drift with random fluctuations
- `sudden_jump`: Innovation-aware sudden jumps
- `random_walk`: Directional random walk
- `replay`: Sophisticated replay with noise

### Enhanced Visualization (`sync.py`)

Updated real-time visualization that shows:

- Innovation values with color coding (Green/Yellow/Red)
- Suspicious GPS count
- GPS-IMU bias with color coding
- Bias standard deviation
- Real-time mitigation status

## Results and Analysis

### Expected Behavior:

1. **Sudden Jump Attacks**:

   - Should be detected when innovation > 5m
   - GPS will be rejected and system falls back to IMU
   - High rejection rate indicates effective mitigation

2. **Gradual Drift Attacks**:

   - May be detected through constant bias analysis
   - Innovation values should stay within threshold
   - Subtle attacks may require machine learning for detection

3. **Random Walk Attacks**:

   - Variable detection depending on step size
   - Innovation values may fluctuate
   - Bias analysis may help detect patterns

4. **Replay Attacks**:
   - May be detected through temporal inconsistencies
   - Innovation values may show unusual patterns
   - Bias analysis may reveal replay characteristics

### Monitoring Metrics:

- **Innovation Magnitude**: Current difference between GPS and IMU
- **Suspicious GPS Count**: Consecutive suspicious readings
- **GPS Acceptance Rate**: Percentage of GPS readings accepted
- **GPS-IMU Bias**: Consistent difference between sensors
- **Bias Standard Deviation**: Consistency of bias over time

## Machine Learning Integration

The system provides data for machine learning-based detection:

### Features for ML:

- Innovation magnitude and history
- GPS acceptance/rejection patterns
- Bias statistics and trends
- Suspicious GPS count patterns
- Mitigation trigger frequency

### Data Collection:

- All metrics are logged in `sequential_attack_test.py`
- Data saved to JSON files for analysis
- Compatible with existing `data_processor.py`

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements:

1. **Fluctuating Innovation Threshold**:

   - Adaptive threshold based on vehicle dynamics
   - Context-aware threshold adjustment

2. **Advanced Bias Detection**:

   - Multi-dimensional bias analysis
   - Temporal pattern recognition

3. **Machine Learning Integration**:

   - Real-time ML-based detection
   - Adaptive threshold learning

4. **Enhanced Visualization**:
   - 3D trajectory visualization
   - Real-time attack detection indicators

## Conclusion

The innovation-based GPS spoofing mitigation system provides:

1. **Detection**: Uses Kalman filter innovation techniques to detect suspicious GPS
2. **Mitigation**: Falls back to IMU when GPS is compromised
3. **Subtle Attacks**: More sophisticated attack strategies
4. **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Data for analysis and ML training
5. **Real-time Response**: Immediate mitigation when attacks are detected
